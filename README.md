# recipe_book

First course project on the Device Agnsotic Design course at Aalto.

The app is called recipe book. It allows you to store your tasty recipes and save them for another use later. The app stores recipes locally using FLutter hive.

The app consists of three main pages:

- On main screen you can see your stored recipes and choose to inspect them. To help you find the desired recipe you can use text filter on top of the page.
- On Recipe inspect screen you can see what are the ingredients in your recipe and descriptions how to make it. You can also add that recipe to your favorites, edit or delete it.
- Recipe creation page has form which allows you to add recipes. Recipe name and description are inserted to textfields but ingredient inputs can be dynamically added or removed to match the amount of ingredients your recipe has.
- Edit recipe looks the same as recipe creation page, but it renders with the inputs field you used to create the recipe which then allows you to edit the recipe.
